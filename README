This library includes functions of various usefulness that I use in my Golang web applications.

Included amongst them are:
- A single function to setup handlers for /assets/, /favicon.{ico,png}, and /robots.txt
    - All served from a relative ./assets/ directory
    - /assets/ allows for easy serving of CSS and such
- Generate random bytes and strings
- HTTP logger middleware
- Some html/template helpers
