This library includes functions of various usefulness that I use in my Golang web applications.

Included amongst them are:
- [go.rice](github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice)-powered static file handling
  - Including favicon and robots.txt helpers
- Generate random bytes and strings
- HTTP logger middleware
- Some html/template helpers
